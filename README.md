# Simple Game

## Goals
I wanted to accomplish several things with this coding project:
1. Practice C/C++ coding.
2. Learn game development.
3. Have fun.

## Technologies
Several technologies that I am learning as part of this project:
1. Chocolatey - https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/why
2. Emscripten - https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html
3. SDL2 - https://www.libsdl.org/
4. Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
5. Make - https://makefiletutorial.com/
6. Powershell - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-powershell/
7. Docker - https://www.docker.com/
8. Git - https://git-scm.com/ | https://github.com/

## Ideas
### Game
1. Starting small is the first goal for this game. Something to learn about creating a simple state-machine (think tic-tac-toe).
2. Once the basic build of the game is in a working state, try using emscripten to build a web version.
3. Once that't done, see if we can host it online (think heroku maybe?) and see how that works.
4. Build on top of the game perhaps???
