# Simple Game

## Idea
This is a sandbox game project where I'm essentially going to through whatever I want at it as part of the learning process :-)

## Goals
I wanted to accomplish several things with this coding project:
1. Practice C/C++ coding.
2. Learn game development.
3. Have fun.

## Technologies
Several technologies that I am learning as part of this project:
1. SDL2 - https://www.libsdl.org/
2. Emscripten - https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html
3. Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
